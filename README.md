# minishell
 The objective of this project is to create a simple shell. My own little bash. 
 
# Demo

```
$ ./minishell
$ > ls
Makefile    bonus        endian.c    minishell    srcs
README.md    bonus_includes    includes    objs        utils
$ > echo "Apple"
Apple
$ > export ME=tjinichi
$ > echo $ME
tjinichi
$ > exit
exit
$
```
